# QSP_Paper_Artifact
This Repo contains several jupyter notebook files that demonstrate two examples of the circuit proposed in https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.02131.pdf (need to update to the latest arXiv version):

1. A 1+2 version (n = 3, m = 1) with all quantum gates hard-coded (O(logN depth with O(N) qubits).
2. A 2+2 version (n = 4, m = 2) with all quantum gates hard-coded (O(logN depth with O(N) qubits).
3. An accompanying qubit-efficient generalized implementation (O(N) depth with O(logN) qubits).

Please contact kgui@uchicago.edu if you have any questions.
